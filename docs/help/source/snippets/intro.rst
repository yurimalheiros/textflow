What are Snippets?
------------------------------------

Snippets are pieces of code that are typed repeatedly. TextFlow offers this tool for the developer avoid typing many times the same code.

The Snippets are more than the simple addition of text quickly, a new excerpt may have fields that will be filled by the user. These fields are easily accessed using keyboard shortcuts.

How To Use?
------------------------------------

Each language supported by TextFlow may have your own Snippets, to activate a Snippet you only need to type a Snippet keyword and press **Tab**, then the Snippet text will be added.

Also the **Tab** key is used to navigate forward through the snippets fields. The shortcut **Shift+Tab** is used to navigate backward.
