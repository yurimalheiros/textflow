Use the **Line ending** combo box to specify the characters used to break a line. TextFlow can manipulate both types of line break, LF and CR LF, but some editors can't, then you should use this option to keep a text file work correctly in many editors. Often Linux editors use LF to break a line and Windows editors use CR LF.

copy contais a ~ at the end of the filename.

Select the **Autosave files every ... minutes** option to automatically
save the current file at regular intervals. Use the spin box to specify
how often you want to save the file.
