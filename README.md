TextFlow
========

Editor
------

TextFlow brings to developers a mix of powerful features, beauty and a great user experience. Development is a creative work, it doesn’t make sense put developers to do boring and repetitive tasks that could be automatized by machines.

The TextFlow goal is turn possible to the developers concentrate in their main activities and do the best job their can.

### Word Completion

When you are typing some text many times you need to repeat a word typed before. To avoid this tedious repetitive work and to minimize type mistakes, TextFlow provides to users a tool for word completion. You only need to press ctrl+space and a suggestion box appear on the screen with words to choose.


Organization
------------

The most of programming projects has a lot of files and often the developers need to open some files, edit these files simultaneously and close files if they want. Manipulate a lot of files may confuse users and low their productivity. To avoid this problem TextFlow provide two features, document tabs and a integrated file browser.

### Tabs
Each open document has a tab in TextFlow, you can change among tabs using mouse or using keyboard shortcuts. You can drag and drop tabs to organize them whatever you want. Use tabs is a efficient way to provide simultaneous file editing.

### File Browser
Using a integrated file browser you have quick access to all files of a project. You can open files, filter them to show only the important files to you, create, delete and rename files or folders.

You don’t need to open other program do manage files, so you can stay seeing your code and focused on your work.

Language Customization
----------------------

TextFlow provides a way to users customize the editor behaviour according the language of current file. Snippets, tools and some properties may be changed automatically when a tab is selected. This is a powerful feature, you can change editor in the speed of a tab change and transform TextFlow to fit the language file needs.

### Snippets

Snippets are pieces of code that, often, are typed repeatedly. These excerpts may have editable fields and all of them are accessible using keyboard shortcuts. Snippets may also have mirrors field, transformation mirrors and stop fields. You have many possibilities using snippets. Use your creativity to create snippets that boost your development speed and quality.

Search and Replace
------------------

A dialog box with dozen options to search? TextFlow doesn’t do that. A incremental search with regex support is provided to users do simple or complex searches in the source file. You only need open the search bar and type. Every match will be highlight as you type.

You also take advantages of every search features in replace operations. Type, see the results on the fly, navigate among the matches and replace with confidence what you want.
